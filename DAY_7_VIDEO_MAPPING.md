# Day 7 Video Mapping Instructions

## 📹 Videos to Add (3 videos total)

Based on the Google Drive folder, here are the videos you need to add and how to name them:

### 1. Breakdowns and Incidents (275-287)
- **Original file:** `rule 275 to 287 incidents and breakdowns_video_1080.mp4`
- **Rename to:** `breakdowns-and-incidents-275-to-287.mp4`
- **Matches PDF:** "Breakdowns and incidents (275 to 287).pdf"
- **Place in:** `frontend/public/course-materials/standard/day-7/videos/`

### 2. Vehicle Loading
- **Original file:** `vehicle loading_video.mp4`
- **Rename to:** `vehicle-loading.mp4`
- **Matches PDF:** This might match "Part Fifteen - Incidents, Accidents and Emergencies" or could be a general vehicle handling topic
- **Place in:** `frontend/public/course-materials/standard/day-7/videos/`
- **Note:** If this doesn't match a specific PDF, I can add it to the most relevant one or create a new entry

### 3. ADAS System
- **Original file:** `ADAS system.mp4`
- **Rename to:** `adas-system.mp4`
- **Matches PDF:** This might be related to vehicle technology/safety systems
- **Place in:** `frontend/public/course-materials/standard/day-7/videos/`
- **Note:** If this doesn't match a specific PDF, I can add it to the most relevant one or create a new entry

## ⚠️ Missing Videos

The following Day 7 PDFs don't have matching videos yet:
- "Road works, level crossings and tramways (288 to 307)" - No video found
- "AED_QA_Flashcards_UK.pdf" - This is a flashcard PDF, likely no video needed
- "Part fiveteen Incidents, Accidents and Emergencies" - No specific video (but video 1 might cover this)

**Note:** That's okay! The app will work fine - students will just see the PDF button first for those materials (no video step).

## ✅ Summary

**Videos to add:**
1. ✅ `breakdowns-and-incidents-275-to-287.mp4`
2. ✅ `vehicle-loading.mp4` (may need to match to appropriate PDF)
3. ✅ `adas-system.mp4` (may need to match to appropriate PDF)

## 📂 Final File Structure

After adding, your `day-7/videos/` folder should contain:
```
frontend/public/course-materials/standard/day-7/videos/
├── breakdowns-and-incidents-275-to-287.mp4
├── vehicle-loading.mp4
└── adas-system.mp4
```

**Important:** Once you've added these videos, let me know and I'll:
1. Match `vehicle-loading.mp4` and `adas-system.mp4` to the most appropriate PDFs
2. Update `courseContent.js` to link all videos to their PDFs
