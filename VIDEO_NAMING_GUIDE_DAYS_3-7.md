## 📁 Where to Place Videos

Place videos in:
- Day 3: `frontend/public/course-materials/standard/day-3/videos/`

## 📝 Day 3 Video Naming

Based on the videos you showed me, here's how to name them to match the PDFs:

### Day 3 Videos:

1. **Driving in Adverse Weather (Rules 226-237)**
   - Current video: `English weather condition 226 to 237_video_1080.mp4`

   - Matches: "Driving in Adverse Weather (Rules 226–237).pdf"

2. **Safety and Your Vehicle**

3. **Let me know** when you've added videos for each day
4. I'll then:
   - Update `courseContent.js` with the video paths
   - Link videos to their corresponding PDFs
   - Ensure the Video → Study → Flashcards → Exam flow works for all days

---

**Important:** 
- Match videos to PDFs based on content/topic, not just filename
- If a video covers multiple PDFs, use the main/primary PDF it matches
- If a PDF doesn't have a corresponding video, that's fine - the app will just show the PDF button first
