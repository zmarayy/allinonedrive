```

## 📝 Video File Naming and Matching

Based on the Google Drive folder, here are the video files and their matching PDFs:

### Day 2 Videos:

1. **Know Your Traffic Signs** (or Traffic Signs PDFs)
   - Video: `road-signs-video.mp4` (rename from "road signs_video_1080.mp4")
   - Matches: "Know Your Traffic Signs", "Traffic Signs Easy Explanation", or "The Highway Code - Traffic Signs"

2. **Rules 36 to 46**
   - Video: `powered-wheelchairs-36-46.mp4` (rename from "Powered wheelchairs and mobility scooters. rule 36 to 46_video.mp4")
   - Matches: "Rules 36 to 46"

3. **Motorcyclists (83-88)**
   - Video: `motorcyclists-83-88.mp4` (rename from "English - Motorcyclist Safety Rules (83-88)_video_720.mp4")
   - Matches: "Motorcyclists (83-88)"

4. **General Rules, Techniques and Advice (103-158)**
   - Video: `rules-103-to-125.mp4` (rename from "Rules 103 to 125_video.mp4")
   - Video: `rules-125-to-143.mp4` (rename from "rule 125 to 143_video_1080.mp4")
   - Video: `rules-144-to-158.mp4` (rename from "rule 144 to 158_video_720.mp4")
   - **Note:** This PDF covers rules 103-158, so we'll use the first video (103-125) as primary, and you can add the others if needed
