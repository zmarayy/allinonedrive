# App Installation Guide Screenshots

## Where to Upload Screenshots

Upload your 3 step-by-step screenshots here:

1. **step-1.png** - First step of the installation process
2. **step-2.png** - Second step of the installation process  
3. **step-3.png** - Third step of the installation process

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- **Aspect Ratio**: 9:16 (portrait/vertical - like a phone screenshot)
- **Recommended Size**: 1080x1920 pixels or similar phone screenshot dimensions
- **File Size**: Keep under 1MB each for fast loading

## File Paths

The images will be accessible at:
- `/images/app-install-guide/step-1.png`
- `/images/app-install-guide/step-2.png`
- `/images/app-install-guide/step-3.png`

## How It Works

Once you upload the images, they will automatically appear in the step-by-step guide on the App page (`/app`). The guide shows:
- Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3
- With numbered badges (1, 2, 3)
- With arrows pointing to the next step
- Responsive layout (horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile)

If images are not uploaded yet, placeholder boxes will show with instructions.
