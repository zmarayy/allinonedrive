# Day 5 Video Mapping Instructions

## 📹 Videos to Add (3 videos total)

Based on the Google Drive folder, here are the videos you need to add and how to name them:

### 1. Waiting and Parking (238-252)
- **Original file:** `Waiting and Parking (Rules 238-252)_video_1080.mp4`
- **Rename to:** `waiting-and-parking-238-to-252.mp4`
- **Matches PDF:** "Waiting and parking (238 to 252).pdf"
- **Place in:** `frontend/public/course-materials/standard/day-5/videos/`

### 2. Part Ten - Vehicle Handling
- **Original file:** `Exam topic_vehicle handling_video_1080.mp4`
- **Rename to:** `vehicle-handling-part-ten.mp4`
- **Matches PDF:** "Part ten Vehicle Handling.pdf"
- **Place in:** `frontend/public/course-materials/standard/day-5/videos/`
- **Note:** This video covers vehicle handling, which matches "Part Ten - Vehicle Handling"

### 3. Other Types of Vehicles
- **Original file:** `exam topic_other type of vehicle_video_1080.mp4`
- **Rename to:** `other-types-of-vehicles.mp4`
- **Matches PDF:** "Other Types of Vehicles.pdf"
- **Place in:** `frontend/public/course-materials/standard/day-5/videos/`

## ⚠️ Missing Videos

The following Day 5 PDFs don't have matching videos yet:
- "Part Nine - Vehicle and Motorcycle Handling" - No video found
- "General rules, techniques and advice for all drivers and riders" - No video found
- "Annex 1 and 2" - No video found

**Note:** That's okay! The app will work fine - students will just see the PDF button first for those materials (no video step).

## ✅ Summary

**Videos to add:**
1. ✅ `waiting-and-parking-238-to-252.mp4`
2. ✅ `vehicle-handling-part-ten.mp4`
3. ✅ `other-types-of-vehicles.mp4`

## 📂 Final File Structure

After adding, your `day-5/videos/` folder should contain:
```
frontend/public/course-materials/standard/day-5/videos/
├── waiting-and-parking-238-to-252.mp4
├── vehicle-handling-part-ten.mp4
└── other-types-of-vehicles.mp4
```

Once you've added these videos with the correct names, let me know and I'll update `courseContent.js` to link them to the PDFs!
